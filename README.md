# Facebook Application README

Welcome to the **Facebook Application** repository! This project is a C# application that demonstrates the use of various design patterns, integration with external APIs, and implementation of applicative features. The application allows users to retrieve generic Facebook information, manage their actions log, and even play a version of Conway's Game of Life.

- Explore a version of Conway's Game of Life.
- Utilize various design patterns including Builder, Observer, Strategy, and more.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/facebook-application.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).

3. Restore the required packages and dependencies.

## Usage

1. Launch the application.

2. Authenticate with your Facebook account to access the requested information.

3. Navigate through the application's interface to retrieve posts, albums, friend photos, and more.

4. View and manage your actions log to keep track of your interactions.

5. Explore and interact with the Conway's Game of Life implementation.

## External APIs

This application leverages the Facebook API to fetch user-specific data. To use the API, you'll need to:

1. Create a Facebook Developer account and set up an application.
2. Obtain an API key or access token.
3. Configure the application to use the API key/token for authentication.

For more detailed information on setting up and using the Facebook API, refer to the official [Facebook for Developers documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/).

## Design Patterns

The Facebook Application showcases the following design patterns:

- Builder: Used to create complex objects step by step.
- Observer: Implemented to provide real-time updates to user actions.
- Strategy: Applied to switch between different algorithms for fetching data.

These patterns enhance the application's maintainability, flexibility, and code organization.

## Conway's Game of Life

The application hosts a version of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton. Interact with the game, observe the patterns, and enjoy its mesmerizing complexity.
